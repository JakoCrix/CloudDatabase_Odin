2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,meu2ee,"LKEtards: Kachi PFS update, Cauchari, Olaroz & Paso site exploration, $1 by Easter ban and farewell. Week(s) in review (28/03/21)","Welly welly Wellington, what a couple of weeks we've had, in a bizarre twist of fate we've had some of the best news coming out for holders and some of the worst performance. I've been talking to a few people and having a good look at the TA of LKE and it seems, at least at this point, that the drop off back down to the support of 30 is a mix of cooling off from the years growth, the natural cycle of investing in a stock in the mining space, and the spooky nature of the market and the eagerness to take profits out and hold captial. The consistently good but not value increasing news has given the green light for a lot of sell offs which now that our volume is so low, makes gaining momentum very difficult. I've said prior that given the markets instability and the nature of being in the DFS stage, that we could see retraces to the low 30's / high 20, guess that checked out. 

As for the news, the PFS update on the Kachi site painted a much better picture of what the future of LKE looks like, The NPV.8 (net present value with a discount of 8%) increased by a whopping 110%. To 2.1billion AUD. This increase is incredible but needs to have a big old * on it. 
The * in this case is it's only worth that money when we get the shit out of the ground. This would, if successful give them a EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 350m AUD at the current projected price rate of lithium, and this is generally conservative as it doesn't fully factor the quality or ESG aspects. This news while absolutely fantastic for long holders, providing we continue our trajectory & transition into production. Using this new evaluation Papa Promnitz is looking at expanding the scope of the Kachi project, and in unexpected news, this new evaluation gave them the confidence and will give them the working captial to open up on their other assets, which was the next piece of news. 

Cauchari is the closest in line for the process, but this is still years off, Cauchari is preparing for it's Pre feasibility study, with Paso and Olaroz still waiting on planning for the drill sites. This news came as a surprise to me, as there was no indication prior that they were seriously looking at any other site than Kachi. 

Looking forward for news, in terms of share price value increasing news we're looking for a few key things, partnerships, offtakers and construction financing, these are all in the works, but it's hard to comment on things that aren't concrete, so far Stephen Promnitz hasn't done wrong by me, so I have no reason to believe he's words in the interviews are not good to go, which for those interested the most recent of which can be found here.

Now, I would have loved to see a dollar by Easter, and truely with the sentiment at the time I made that bet I was fully signed up for it. Unfortunately that proved to be a bit unreasonable with the gassed up market tuning the momentum right down as people started to pull out and take profits. I still feel, truely, that a dollar per share will seem like penuts in the long term, but that's definitely looking minimum a year and a half off. Depending on the reveals of news we could definitely hit it this year. But for the holders I would be looking at 1.5-2 years out currently. 

Not sure what the nature of my ban is, waiting for the executioner to message me. But for however long I'm gone, it's been an honour serving with you. Disclosure, Currently hold at an average of 28c, buying if it ever dips around 30, not planning on selling till $3+ but may hold longer depending on the story. DYOR retards.

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mec9nc,Random Stonk of the Week - Reckon (RKN),"As mentioned previously, I'll be picking a random ASX stock that I've (personally, yes I'm aware it may have been posted here at some point in history) never seen discussed on this sub - and that I do NOT hold - for us to discuss per week.

This is for us all to have a look at what it does, some of their financials, and in the end discuss whether or not we'd buy into it.

Think of it as a sort of ""group DD"" in which we pool our 5 collective braincells together and evaluate the chosen company.

The main purpose being to add some more variety in tickers to all the standard meme stocks we see pumped day in and day out, and hopefully discover some hidden gems - or at least, less stinky forms of dogshit.

The only other criteria is that the share price has to be under $2.

So, without further smug explanations:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Random ASX Stonk of the Week - Week 5:

**Company name:** Reckon Limited

**Ticker:** RKN

**Industry:** IT

**Headquarters:** Sydney

**Market cap:** $90m

**Current share price:** $0.8

**P/E ratio:** 9.5

**1-year Performance:** \+68.42%

**What they do, smoothbrain version:** the Diet, Sugarless, Caffeine-free, Clear Pepsi version of Xero

**What they say they do, wanky version:** ""Accounting software for busy people - spend less time managing your finances and more time on growing your business."" 🍆👋

**What they do, actual version:** ""iS tHiS tHe NeXt xErO?"" Probably not.

Sydney-based Reckon is a multi-purpose business software & solutions company that has been around since 1987 and provide a range of cloud and SaaS based services. These cover things like accounting, payroll, and POS (that's Point of Sale, not Piece of Shit in this case, retards).

They officially divide their business into three core software groups: Accountants, Business, and Legal, but by all indications, it's the accounting portion of the company that carries the load financially.

Their Legal system/team in theory looks like it has potential, with a lot of legacy users out there still on oldschool desktop instead of cloud software they could potentially convert over, however it looks like a drag on the company instead.

They employ over 300 people, and their original founder/chairman is still involved in the business today.

**What looks good:**

* Profit after tax was up around 20% over previous period, while the bulk of their revenue (85%) comes from recurring subscriptions, aka reducing the reliance on necessarily needing to constantly acquire new customers to survive.
* Their annual user growth looks good, if not amazing. They've got over 100k of cloud users, with 35% growth in users annualised.
* They're positioned in a good place technically, with everything cloud and app-based, so they're not one of these older software dinosaurs that needs to rebuild everything to pivot.
* They provide a big-ass (I know we're Aussie, but whenever I type ""big-arse"" it looks like a drunken Irishman typed it, so ""ass"" it is) dividend for a relatively small-ass company. 5.7% is massive yield for a company of this size, meaning even if you just get a bit of Share Price growth on top of it you've already received returns that would make AusFinance moist.
* I'll say this for them; their front-end design and user experience on their systems, website, and even their annual report is slick and modern. Credit to their UX guys where credit is due.
* They've made some efforts to reduce their debt (more on that below) over the past couple of years, which is at least somewhat good to see.
* Their P/E ratio of under 10 is impressive and efficient given their market cap.
* They've been around since 1987, which is good in the sense that they're not some fly-by-night SaaS business that is likely to go under should you throw your dollars at them.

**What doesn't look good:**

* Lots of debt. Like, I believe the official term here is a ""fuckload"" of debt. Considering their size, even though they've paid down a chunk the last couple of years, having \~$36 mill or so of debt is hiiiigh. I get they need to continually fund development etc. to stay competitive, and release new products, but jeez.
* Considering how much they have spent on development per year, it doesn't look like any of the newer products they have pumped out have had as much effect on the bottom line as they should have.
* Their management/exec team are also on pretty BIG salaries for the size and revenue of the company. For a handful of them each getting paid $800k+ per year, you can only return me 20% growth in profit during one of the biggest tech booms we've ever seen? Eh.
* A heavily competitive space given the likes of Xero, MYOB, and other more famous names exist, and given how typically hesitant businesses are to switch over software platforms given the effort, may be hard to steal market share.
* The fact that you probably asked ""Who the fuck are these guys?"" when you opened this thread is a case in point regarding brand recognition. As mentioned above, they've been around since 1987... less money on pure development, and more on marketing needed perhaps?
* Past deals have fallen through that would have helped drastically reduce their debt, including one with MYOB a few years ago which would have bought in a cool $180m of revenue, however MYOB got cold feet, their share price plummeted, and has never recovered.
* Share price has declined significantly since their peak around 2015, and while it's climbed up a lot since its Covid-induced bottom in March 2020, it's still only back to hovering around pre-Covid levels
* Brand name is pretty stupid, I ""Reckon"". But then again, so is Xero.

**Overall rating (strong buy/buy/hold/avoid):** This one is a little confusing to me, as the indications are there in terms of product quality, fundamentals of revenue, and tech capability that they probably should be bigger or more recognised than they are. This Covid ""work from home boom"" period saw many other software/SaaS companies share prices soar - so why didn't Reckon's?

You'd think with the general appeal of tech combined with their pretty sexy dividend that more investors in general would have been drawn to this - perhaps it's the debt level that scares them off? If users are growing 35% annually, why isn't that reflected as well in their revenue?

I'm flagging this as an AVOID personally, as it flies in the face of the indicators I usually look for financially to instead seem like it's not going to fly anywhere amazing in the near future. It may be one to try for those looking for a dividend investment with potential growth upside however.

Given the diverse styles that I see people in this sub using, I’ve been inspired to write up a short list of position size strategies. I see investing as comprising two major skills, identification (DD) and risk mitigation. One way to manage risk is through position size. I don’t think there is a “right” way to do it. It all depends on one's aims and risk tolerance.

If you think this is advice, you're more retarded than I am.

Anywho, here are some distinct methods I'm familiar with:

**All-In** – Betting is a game of percentages, right? Can’t say I’ve tried this with stocks, but I admire the balls it takes to do it. Worst case scenario of losing everything is very real in the spec stocks. Trading halt could lock down capital for a long time. One could be forced into a huge loss in order to exit a position that may never recover (or best case, take years). Conversely, it might double your money very quickly.

**Kelly Criterion** – This is an approach to gambling using a mathematical formula to determine ideal bet size. It maximizes returns over time while reducing the chance of bombing out. The math behind it gets a bit complicated so check out the wiki. But basic method is to take one's odds as % chance to win, multiply by 2, and subtract 100 to determine bet size as a % of total capital. This can be applied to trading/investing. Idea is to measure one's own hit rate (% stock picks that win) and use that as the odds to apply the formula to. It’s kind of an elegant method as it scales to an individual's ‘skill’ level.

**Risk Tolerance Method** – This involves determining personal tolerance for risk and using that as a basis for determining position size. For example, risk tolerance level might be 2% of total capital. In trading, that might mean using stop loss distance in conjunction to risk level to work out the position size. In investing, it might mean managing each position so that no single one is larger than the risk tolerance level.

**Standard Allocation** – I read that commonly investors end up with a portfolio of 20-30 stocks. This works out to be 3-5% position sizes. It’s not necessarily right or even ideal, but I guess could be considered a standard allocation of sorts. I think that using this position size isn’t too bad, though maybe a bit too conservative for me?

**Diversification** – I think this method is most useful for people who want to preserve their capital above all else. Tangibly this might mean buying an ETF or a set of ETFs to spread risk across many stocks and/or asset classes. I think there is something to be learned from splitting positions between sectors and major industries, even if the individual positions are large. If all of the stocks in a portfolio move together, it may be hard to take advantage of opportunities in inversely correlated parts of the market.

**Tier System (123 Method)** – Not sure if this is a thing, but this is generally how I approach it. It involves the risk tolerance method, but as an addition, I use perceived risk level to justify larger position sizes. Essentially, I take my base risk tolerance % to determine the size of one parcel of stock. Then for stocks with less perceived risk, I allow for 2x or 3x parcel allocation. As an example, if my risk tolerance was 3% of total capital, that would allow for a maximum commitment of 9-10% for a single low risk position.

Somewhat related is entry and exit methods. E.g. one chunk, averaging in, targets sell points, free carrying, etc. Might be interesting to write about in future.

We have had rockets, red days, YOLO's, an oddly heartfelt [Dear Diary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m86ce5/trading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post, more Koala's adopted than you can shake a stick at, shit talking a plenty and a truckload of new bets to round it all out.

Y'all are getting better at tagging a **Mod** for your demented gambling and *proof or ban* calls, just another friendly reminder ''Mods'' **DOES NOT** summon us.

We like it when you call us by name, any mod is fine, all roads lead to a paddlin....

&#x200B;

Oh, a little side note from the **Mod team**.

Just cause it ain't a penny does not immediately make it a shit pick. Tell that to the folks with the $9 APT buy ins...Or the people who bought APT Warrants for $4.

Also, someone telling you your stonk is shit does not mean they are a '*shorter*', seriously learn what the fuck it actually means. If you think everyone who says your pick is garbage is a shorter, you have a sore misunderstanding of what judgement is. If you call someone a (shudder), Down-Ramper on this sub expect a paddlin, take that shit back to hot crapper. We like people to have opposing views, in theory it makes us look slightly more intelligent when you can see just a whisker past your own smooth brain. Besides, we keep telling people to look into Options and Warrants, those things that mean you make money when something implodes in price.

&#x200B;

Ok mod rant over, so without any further ado lets get through the madness and fuck off too enjoy the weekend....

&#x200B;

**HIGHLIGHTS**

&#x200B;

\- **64,000 + members**. Again, fuck me.

&#x200B;

\- Auto-Mod has some sass. Mention Hot Crapper, Motley Fuckwit or the Dildo producing mining speccie and you'll see why.

&#x200B;

\- Speaking of Dildo's, you retards managed to make [DLC the #1 mentioned Stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m7nl6l/dlc_officially_asx_bets_most_mentioned_stock_top/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on the Sub.

Its funny, its beyond stupid and its completely incomprehensible that anyone could construe this as financial advice.

&#x200B;

\- Admittedly, the collective senses of the **Mods** have been dulled over time, (you can only be exposed to so much degenerate shenanigans before you go a little numb) but we were stoked to see all the Koala donations over the last few weeks, culminating in the [Koala Donations making the news](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m8sfv4/asx_bets_in_print_in_the_australian_boomer_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

We also had a go at totaling up the collective good vibes, you can check it out [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m9uspj/since_the_charity_flairathon_began_we_have/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

\- An [Open question the the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m615bt/open_question_to_the_moderators_what_are_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) popped up. We assumed any open question to us was going to be sexual, but turns out this one was stonk related. **Mod** chat was collectively a little disappointed it wasn't more racy, but then disappointment from the **Mods** is about normal for anything vaguely sexual.

&#x200B;

\- We also had the [ASIC Interview post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb3bfq/the_fuzz_are_here_asic_and_rasx_bets_q_and_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for all y'all who missed it.

&#x200B;

\- u/noobinvestin has been at it again, this time with a [100K DEG YOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m8c6ur/100k_on_deg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This user has some big boy table plays in the market across a few tickers now...

&#x200B;

\- u/Steph_Cape came through with some astounding [Loss Porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mclkdr/no_lube_used_on_this_pounding_that_hardcore_nxl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), consolation prize for all that red was a new porn-star alias Flair.

&#x200B;

\- u/Hussysmurf has been getting creative again, this time with a little [Birthday Video celebration.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m56qne/happy_birthday_you_beautiful_degenerates_xox/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Smurfs videos are always quality and this one is no exception.

&#x200B;

\- Apparently [Stonk jogging](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb7os9/the_unofficial_asx_bets_monthly_afternoon_jogging/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a thing now. AFR, SBS, etc... you heard it here first, its all those damn redditors are talking about. Looking forward to seeing how you credit the originator, u/Mutated_Cunt into a mainstream news article.

Puts on Mainstream Media.....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**NEW BETS**

&#x200B;

\- u/ninenet909 has made a bold bet, stating that [EXR will touch $1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m3cyi6/weekend_thread_for_general_discussion_and_plans/gqqpggi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by December 30th or they will  shave a line down the middle of their head. We have not yet finalized a length of time for said line to remain in-situ, suggestions are welcome in the comments section but the minimum is 72 hours.

&#x200B;

\- u/blaze7736 has bet **XST** will be above 2c by the end of the month or they will buy [the dildo stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m56h12/market_open_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqz6s78?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Another potential T20 holder on the horizon.

&#x200B;

\- u/nextFloat says **XST** will touch 1.9c by the end of the month or they will take a  [week ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m634se/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gr45a0r?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as with all touching we hope its inappropriate.

&#x200B;

\- u/luner124 took the contrarian side, saying if **XST** touches 2c (inappropriately or otherwise) before the [end of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m634se/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gr6jz2x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), they'll take a weeks ban and admit stonks do only go up.

&#x200B;

\- u/peglegsmeg stated **IXR** will be [.6 in 2 weeks time](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m6ug3z/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gr7zigu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or they get banned for a month, time to get drilling...

&#x200B;

\- u/Dark_Raiden_ believes **PUR** will hit 10c within the next 2 weeks or they will take a [1-month ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m6ug3z/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gr81gn9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The suspense will no doubt cause some trauma for this user.

&#x200B;

\- u/crookgypsy claims **ADX** will hit 1.4c by [mid year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m6ug3z/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gr8bsvg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or they will take a months ban.

Who can know why?

&#x200B;

\- u/JDK-Ruler made an alternate bet so they didn't have to buy **CBA**, instead opting for [DW8 to hit 0.15 before April 8th](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/macnrz/anyone_bought_into_cce_sustainable_energy/grt0mc5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or they will be exiled to the ban netherworld.

&#x200B;

\- u/itsdankreddit is back on the bike, chancing a [weeks ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb8u5b/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/grwmxwp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to crush the hopes of u/nomadnobad's target buy in, with u/Benny90210 jumping [in on the action](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb8u5b/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/grwspbp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

&#x200B;

\- u/FameLuck  claims **BPH** will get the approval by 31st of May or they will cop a [1 year ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lxbdeh/i_have_used_this_picture_before_but_its_more/gpml9ts?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). They have also specified that they will buy $5k of **BPH** by [next Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mcs6z7/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gs6chqk?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) or be banned.

&#x200B;

\- u/Sperlo86 is riding high on the **Air-tasker IPO**, claiming it will be [$2 by the end of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbsu70/higher_it_goes/gs06yqu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). There is a 2nd part to this bet, with a further claim it will be [$5 by the End of April.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbsu70/higher_it_goes/gs06yqu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

We shall see if they make it past part one....

&#x200B;

\- u/toolman2019 has taken the contrarian route for **ART**, desiring a weeks ban if it is [still over $1 by weeks end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbzm15/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gs119d8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Some potential time off to ''*reassess their life in general*'' I believe...

&#x200B;

\- Contrarian betting seems to be the flavour of the moment, when u/ChalkyAus bet a week off with an [RAC Thursday announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbzm15/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gs0u9pw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), u/Mitchuation immediately went the opposite saying they will take a weeks ban if the [Announcement arrived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbzm15/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gs0vxq3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

\- u/Yaals has come through with a last minute bet, [EXR to high a high of .42 Friday or ban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mcs6z7/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gs5934u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**BANS**

&#x200B;

\- u/BonerBoi_69 has been given a Ban for an alleged [koala theft](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m5d911/in_light_of_recent_activity_in_wsb_i_adopted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

&#x200B;

\- u/Markma1989 has been banned for failing to come through on a [Proof or Ban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m94285/i_wonder_when_will_qantas_go_rocket/grktshq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) We considered doubling the ban length because it was for fucking Qantas, but going mad with power isn't on the menu this week.

&#x200B;

\- u/fact_not_salty_tears has been banned for a violation of **Rule 9**.

We take that shit seriously folks...

&#x200B;

\- u/SlattKingThugger was banned for failing to come good on a [Proof or Ban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb11ii/i_placed_my_second_trade_today_at_idt_boys_bought/grvbrde?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

\- u/TheMikeMurphyShow was banned for failing a call for [proof or ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mb5dic/bloody_hell_anyone_worth_than_me/grwd9cm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) over some tasty loss porn.

&#x200B;

\- u/Electrical_Drummer_9 has been banned for ignoring a proof or ban on a [BRN buy in](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mabag7/if_only_i_wasnt_such_a_brn_pussy_and_dropped_more/grs4w7z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

\- u/intadimensionaldisco has been banned for a month after a [false claim post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mbehih/ihldw8exrother_which_to_long_term_hold/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

\- u/AussieVikingr was requested a ban after confusing **RNU** with **RSG**, some time was required to check google earth and discover there is actually a whole world out there...

&#x200B;

In case you can't read Greek, Easter cometh and with it, a multitude of **LKE** tards departing for quiet time or dyeing their hair purple unless we have a Easter miracle and it cranks up to the $1 mark. Though if you do read Greek, odds are Easter isn't for another Month.

&#x200B;

Also,  [u/WistfulWhiskers](https://www.reddit.com/u/WistfulWhiskers/)  &  [u/FL0wstonks](https://www.reddit.com/u/FL0wstonks/)  The end of April will be here before you know it and we shall be talking soon.....

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mcfvsk,WOA,"Some DD for you to sink your teeth into. The stock is WOA - Wide Open Agriculture, based in WA. I get that agriculture isn’t the sexiest play on the ASX but hear me out my fellow spectrum dwellers. They have 3 key business segments, two of which should see huge growth.

1. Regenerative food brand ‘Dirty Clean Foods’ - this was their core product line prior to recent developments. Essentially they manufacture basic meat and food products sourced exclusively from suppliers who undertake regenerative farming practices - nice tick of the box for you ethical investors out there. Nothing particularly exciting here, other than the fact that they are expanding distribution of these products to the east coast of Australia (currently these products are only sold in the West Australian market), therefore the potential for sales to increase exists. This product line alone, even factoring in the expansion, is not worthy of investing in this stock, especially by the astronauts reading this, but worth knowing nonetheless.

2. Oat milk ‘Oat Up’. Here is where the investment thesis starts to heat up. They have recently launched a line of oat milk to compete in the increasingly popular alternative milk market. The current addressable global market was estimated at $3.7 billion in 2019. Oat milk sales worldwide have increased by over 108% in the past year, compared to single digit growth for soy and negative growth for almond milk. In particular it is gaining huge momentum in Asia, which WOA plans to export to. The timeline for expansion of this product line is to distribute to the east coast of Aus and Asian markets by q4 this year. Currently they outsource the manufacturing, however are undertaking a feasibility study for building a manufacturing facility to produce it on their own.

3. Lupin based protein. This is the big one apes, the rocket fuel, if you will. The popularity of plant based protein is surging, with the market expected to be worth $28 billion by 2025. Look no further than the success of Beyond Meat in the US market. WOA has partnered with CSIRO and Curtin University to develop their own lupin based meat alternative. Current plant based alternatives use soy and other inputs. None use lupin. Lupins are a very cheap and readily available seed that is mostly used for livestock feed (and mostly grown in Australia). They are far cheaper and more protein dense than other alternatives and have chemical structures (I’m no expert here admittedly) that make it more easily integrated into food products for a better tasting meat alternative. The key for WOA is they have executed an exclusive license agreement with Curtin University for the lupin product - i.e. they have a durable moat or ‘competitive advantage’ (dumbed down for you special people) in that the product cannot be replicated. The company has set out clear timelines for the development of the lupin product (and to date management has been very good at communicating and keeping to their timelines). They have completed proof of concept trials and are currently in the middle of commercialization studies. Results of these trials will be announced within the next month or so. Therefore whilst some risk still exists, the major hurdles have been cleared and it is largely derisked at this stage. Also worth noting is the company plans to not only produce their own products in this space, but will look to supply the lupin ‘gel’ to other manufacturers such as Beyond Meat to use in their products, therefore it may not necessarily be in direct competition with the key players in the market but rather will partner with them to create another line of sales. 

In terms of fundamentals, they recently did a cap raise, so they are cashed up for the future (based on current cash burn they are more than fine for the medium term) - the money will be used to continue to lupin development and to build the oat milk manufacturing plant in the future. Revenues have increased year on year (up 257% on last year based on the recent financials - which does not take into account the recent oat milk launch sales and obviously not factoring in the future lupin products which realistically should dwarf their current turnover).

In terms of share price action, it is currently trading sideways, between 65c - 90c for most of the last 6 months (there was a short term spike well above $1 briefly last year when the market got excited about the lupin developments but my guess is wise traders booked their 300%+ profits therefore the consolidation back down into the current range). I’d say it’s reasonably valued at the moment but future developments not priced in, investors will want to see some actual output before betting the farm. The share registry is very tightly held (less than 100 million SOI which is excellent for a small cap and suggests they have not had to repeatedly issue new shares in order to continually fund their business - for context many of the micro caps you read about in these parts have well over a billion shares issued) and management still holds a significant portion of SOI which is a very positive sign. Not many eyes on this one at the moment and not well known outside of WA so an under appreciate stock in my opinion. If I have one criticism of management it’s that they haven’t done a good job of spreading the word to the broader market and institutional investors in order to generate interest but I have no doubt once people catch on that will take care of itself.

There are lots of really good announcements that have been released to the market that summarize the above information if you want to better understand this for when you ask your wife’s boyfriend for cash to invest, but hopefully I’ve summarized this well enough to give you some context.

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mbehih,IHL/DW8/EXR/other? - which to long term hold?,"Hey team,

Just dumped some more of my boomer stocks and now have more petty cash to dump into some more stonks. 

I am looking into IHL, DW8 or EXR for a long term play. I am invested in all already, sub 5k for all, but am considering dropping my petty cash (20k) on one of them and just deleting commsex and forgetting about the stock for well beyond 12 months. I could just pick which one I like most based on my DD, but I always like a second second opinions. Two autists are better than one, right? 

Any recommendations about those stocks for long term plays? Basically, I am wanting to field which stock/s people think has a good long term upside and if you have any decent DD I would love to read the same before doing an aderall vortex and doing my own DD for 2 days straight to see if we align (or vice versa). But hey, I am open to hearing about any other stocks you would drop 20k on for a long term play, and why?

Like I said, I have done my own DD on the above stocks (in addition to reading quality DD here), but I am sitting on a three way fence at the moment and I am sick of my asshole getting torn to shreds.

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mb7os9,The (un)Official ASX_Bets Monthly Afternoon Jogging competition,"#Intro

Welcome back cunts. As promised, I'm here to deliver my (un)official calculations on which stocks are the best (and worst) at putting on their runners and heading out for an afternoon stroll. This meme started because a bunch of LKEtards, lacking a real reason to believe in the price going up, starting spamming the daily thread that their favorite stock would always go up in the afternoon, hence going for a jog. To quantify this, I've sperged out and analysed the jogging capability of every stock on the ASX with a market cap greater than $50m, for a total of 1225 tickers.

#Methodology

How can we actually measure the ""Jogging Value"" for a ticker? From Yahoo finance, pulling data from the previous month, I have calculated how much money you would earn if you bought a stock at 12pm, and sold at close. This quantifies as the ""Jog"". Starting from a balance of $10000, and including a $9.50 transaction fee for each buy/sell, I've plotted the running account balance you'd get for repeating the ""Jog"" every day for the previous month. At the end, I've subtracted the $10k starting balance to get the ""Absolute Jogging Value"" for a stock. 

[Here is the plot of all 1225 running values, and a Histogram of their Absolute Jogging Value](https://imgur.com/a/wNoEEhv)

As you can see, I've made quite the mess. Most stocks are very tame joggers, budging very little about $0, and on average, its a losing strategy. Buy and HODL is a much more effective strategy than timing a jog. Outliers do emerge, and so without further ado I give you lists of the top 20 best and worst Absolute Joggers.

#Discussion

There are some crowd favorites in both, LRS is chiming in at #4 for the worst jogger, far outstripping its Lithium brother LKE, which I calculated at -$509. The Boomers at Hotcrapper are represented proudly by RAC at #10 in the worst joggers, no surprises there.

Terracom Ltd (TER) is the laziest cunt on the market , doing a bit too much [""Hard Coking""](https://www2.commsec.com.au/quotes/summary?stockCode=TER&exchangeCode=ASX), whereas Carnegie Clean Energy (CCE) has channeled its ability to [scam investor money](https://themarketherald.com.au/carnegie-clean-energy-asxcce-posts-1-2m-net-loss-for-h1-fy21-2021-02-26/) into a gigantic afternoon sprint to claim the top prize.

#The Relative Jog Analysis


But wait, what happened to the LKE jog? The absolute value is negative? To dive deeper, I went ahead and calculated the ""Relative Jogging Value"" for each stock. If a stock is going up in general, by subtracting the starting balance of $10k from the jogging value, we're not measuring the jog strictly, but some of the overall momentum involved as well.

 To get a relative jogging value, I instead subtracted the amount of cash you would have if you bought and held the stock instead of timing an afternoon jog. 

For example, if I bought $10k worth of XYZ, and it went up 30% in a month, and if by timing the jog I would be up 28%, the Relative Jogging Value would be (0.28-0.3)*10000 = -$200, whereas the Absolute Jogging Value is (0.28)*10000 =  $2800. Similarly, a stock that has a negative Absolute Jogging Value can have a positive relative jogging value.

The relative jogging value is measuring how much of that ""gain"" is coming from the size of the afternoon jog relative to the size of the gain overall. The lowest values are from the cunts that do the most work in the morning, and fuck off in the afternoon. Another way to think of it is that the relative jogging value is the money you ""Gain/Lose"" from trying to time the jog compared to buying and holding.

If you can rub your two brain cells together and make sense of that, [here is how the histogram changes for the Relative Jogging values of all stocks.](https://imgur.com/a/LCchimX)

Overall, most stocks land below and close to zero, but we get some very large negative performers, seems like some heavy morning pumping action is going on.

Again, here are the lists of the top and bottom 20 Relative Joggers.

As you can see, the listings change dramatically. Shout out to ONE for going from #5 in the Absolute Jogger list to a clear #1 in the worst Relative Jogger list, seems like someone gets heavily pumped in the morning and dumped in the afternoon. RAC remains in the bottom 20, but slipping to only #16.
AXE becomes the new king of the joggers, sitting proudly at #1.

And yes, LKE has a relative jogging value of $1343.80, which is indeed better than most stocks, but there's a whole bunch more that leave LKE behind in the dust when it comes to the afternoon race, so find something else to spam you unoriginal fucks.

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mb3bfq,The fuzz are here. ASIC and /r/ASX_Bets Q and A,"In light of articles saying they had an '*eye on social media*', we made a pro-active step and contacted the **ASIC** in September 2020. No response was received other than a receipt of message, so we simply continued along our merry way.

When we followed up a few months later, we were informed our offer of communication (including a Mods personal email and phone number) had been 'non actioned' and subsequently closed.

Advice from the **ASIC** on the second call was that we should contact them again if we really needed to (including providing a specific group to call). Again, no news is good news.

&#x200B;

A little over a week ago, we were contacted by a person claiming to be representing **ASIC**. We have a verification process for whenever someone contacts the Mods claiming to be somebody. After their identity was confirmed, we were advised the purpose of the contact was a non specific meeting to see the lay of the land.

The Mods conferred, it was decided that one Mod would happily attend via phone. Apparently no investigation is happening, this was a friendly chat and it was not recorded by **ASIC**.

&#x200B;

A few questions were asked, but just to clarify and maintain our transparency, we thought we'd answer them here too.

The actual meet up was over the phone, only one mod was present.

The questions below are listed from memory and subsequent Mod dialogue.

&#x200B;

**What do you get paid?**

Nothing.

Sweet fuck all to be precise, just doing it for the love and tears of spammers. A Quality shit-post now and then also does wonders for morale.

Initially, One of the Mods did pay for a few things out of their own pocket (*The Koala and Banner, designers and base art aren't free, even if they got it for mates rates*).

In lieu of this and to put out some funnies for the Autistic crowd to call their own, a shitty merch store was set up via RedBubble. Once that debt is paid, they are considering to shut the shop, unless another person starts trying to skim money by stealing the Koala.

Mods have a rule you may or may not be aware of. We do not accept gifts, donations, payments, and any associated funny business. Sexual favours will not get you special treatment, just deep disappointment. Any time we are offered something, we suggest the user spend that money on a donation to charity instead. Someone shilling generally and offering Discounts and offers of 200 free accounts to **the entire sub** are fine, but mod only stuff is a no no. Though beers have been bought for mods (and others) at meetups and someone probably got a pizza once.

We do not enter the competitions we allow to be run on the Sub.

As a general guide, we avoid shilling our own stonks, in actual fact when a post pops up concerning a ticker a Mod is invested in, we often try to flag it in our mod chat and one of the other Mods makes the call on it. (keep/delete/re-flair etc...). Mods can still delete each others posts.

Even if we dont mention a stonk to each other, there are still multiple mods. Trash and pump is still trash and pump. It will get deleted. If trash is being approved, questions will be asked by other mods.

We occasionally gamble on shitty stocks we see shilled here, generally only to skulk away and lament our own foolishness.

&#x200B;

**How much time do you spend doing this?**

&#x200B;

Mods might spend anywhere between 3-12 hours a week moderating the sub. Cut up into 5-10 minute blocks. Yes people, you got your no effort post deleted while the mod was sitting down on the toilet.

When there is a major problem or huge spikes in interest (BRNageddon/GME/Any fucking time Z1P goes up etc...) Mod's can spend up to double this amount sorting it out.

This isn't always fun and can be pretty demanding, but its a reality of the role. Remember, there is a large volume you don't see via mod mail and other requests that come in.

&#x200B;

**Does every post get Pre-approved by a mod?**

&#x200B;

No way. This isn't our job. That's not how the internet works.

We just don't have time to approve everything that people say, plus we don't want too. The sub would become an extension filter of the stuff Mod's wanted to see only. Think of all the shit you would not have been subjected to if this was the case, can you imagine a world where we deprived you of logging on to see what people were buying and ended up watching some dude drink his own jizz? Nah, that job goes to the mod who drew the short straw. Other mods still haven't seen that video.

Also, that would mean we have to review everything immediately. News of something Mooning or crashing would be delayed spreading and no one could act while the approver had a look and furrowed their brow while pondering whether to say yes. What do we look like? A Commsec Options account?

Plus, the reddit downvote function provides a small assistance to us. If someone is just pumping or spamming, the downvoters will prevent that clogging up everyone's feeds anyway until we get to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How fast can you respond to a post?**

&#x200B;

Often within 1-2 hours, a mod has looked over things. Often it's much faster. We largely use Sort by New. Reddit does do strange stuff with sorting, but this usually means things get caught.

We also have mod-mail, which provides alerts to Mods who have it set up right. Certain apps don't actually do this correctly, so it's not a surefire way to get an immediate alert to a mod, but it will get looked at. We also get reports, which are flagged to us when we look at the sub.

The best and fastest way to contact a mod has and will always be tagging them on the post by their username.

&#x200B;

**How can you respond to people doing dodgy stuff?**

&#x200B;

As swiftly as possible. People just doing low quality memes and being a bit too enthusiastic so as to make us slightly suspicious simply get deleted. But if there appears to be any coordinated posts etc, we will often get modmails, chats or people @ us. If multiple posts with the same text appear, that is a dead giveaway. For bad behaviour, we might give people a warning flair, while banning the alts. If they misbehave again, they will go for a temporary or permanent ban.

&#x200B;

The more co-ordinated the event, the more aggressive we are. It's hard to prove pumping or co-ordination, so we tend to be careful about flat out banning.

&#x200B;

We have had an attempted pump when a discussion group off the subreddit went from hysterical enthusiasm for a stock (which is fine) to planning a pump. We stopped it before the pump was supposed to happen, partially to ensure no actual laws were broken, (i.e no market manipulation **ASIC**).

The ringleader was banned, plus the people involved were, ranging from short bans for fellow travellers to longer ones for people who clearly knew what they were a part of when it went to the dark side.

&#x200B;

**How do you choose mods?**

&#x200B;

Basically through a process of being aware that we need a new mod because the load is too high and we start reviewing who appears to be acting in an adult way, or at least a childish way but appears to actually be an Adult inside. While we are welcoming to all, including morons, we don't want them to be mods.

Every mod was looked over carefully before being offered the spot. Only one mod had offered their services before being chosen, but they were already on view as a possible. People who look like they might abuse the position are not chosen.

Everyone, do not ask us to become a mod. Don't call us, we'll call you.

&#x200B;

**Does the Mod team agree on everything? Is** /u/The_lordofruin **the boss?**

&#x200B;

No and no.

While a mod is very new, their access is not fully active. But as long as they don't misbehave, they have the same access as the others mods within a few weeks. Think of it like a probationary period.

There is a single common chat channel that the mods use for 99% of their communication, though 1 on 1 does happen. Previously, there were other channels when there were far fewer mods. But these channels are rarely used now except for sending files and information back and forth that reddit doesn't handle well.

We have a group email account separate to the sub, also shared spreadsheets and other bits and pieces to assist us with all thing modding.

95% of descisions made by mods are unilateral.

They see shit and they delete shit. If something looks like it needs an alert to everyone (like co-ordinated pumpers or a user not quite crossing the line, but still being a dick and likely a future problem), then the other mods are alerted.

Over time, Different mods have fallen into different roles. One mod does a lot of ban post co-ordination, another does automod, another tends to do Commenting, Another does most of the flairs and another likes killing bots and sock puppets.

Mixed in with this is their general activities, you would expect a group over time to evolve into these types of roles.

&#x200B;

Unlike how certain larger subreddits operate, we do not have an inner party and an outer party of mods.

/u/The_lordofruin is a major poster and is sometimes requested as a particular ""oh no...Mum/Dad is here."" scary alert Mod. But that's largely a matter of history and that certain other mods do not like too much attention. As you would expect, the mods who have been around longer are afforded a level of respect both within the sub and the Mod circle. They have probably seen it before, they have had more time programming auto-mod, are more familiar with the sub etc etc...

But the Elder Mods are not the bosses, the mods work together but aren't a monolithic unit and when we disagree on a certain course of action or direction, group consensus prevails.

&#x200B;

People who do not mod are likely not aware of it, but if you are a mod, Reddit allows scheduled posts. One mod can draft something, schedule the post to be released the next day. Another mod can then go in, edit and expand that post before it goes live. This means multiple mods are actually the Author, but it only goes under one user.

Case in point, multiple Mods have read this post and either edited or approved it prior to it going live.

&#x200B;

**How do you keep the mods from misusing their power?**

&#x200B;

There is a mod log thats kept up, tracking all things done by the mods.

In theory, a mod could misuse it, but if something is deleted then a user can use mod-mail or message another mod. The other mods would get an alert, then review the post in question. Eventually questions would get asked. Mods sometimes will say ""I'm in XYZ, I'm too close. You guys decide if this is a reasonable post or if I'm too close and this is actually shit.""

&#x200B;

As with any group, trust plays a role. The more time the current mod group spends refining their craft, the better we are at maintaining the culture here at r/ASX_Bets.

&#x200B;

In theory, certain mods can close the entire sub and say Fuck you all. However, they have their episode of '*going mad with power*' scheduled for next Full moon, not today. Right after they finished crying that their biggest holdings have not mooned despite 3 years being balls deep. \[That hurts you bastard- other mod editing this\]

&#x200B;

**Why is there lots of text in Greek? Is it some trick being used to hide messages and bypass the Automod?**

&#x200B;

**hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

&#x200B;

It's a long long story that actually needed explaining to **ASIC**.  Yes, they really did ask this seriously.

It's actually an '*in*' joke because some idiot took a random Greek article as evidence **BRN** was going to moon. This article was just a random article, but the joke developed that people will believe anything they read in Greek.

It's still going on 6 months later, not the mooning, the Greek joke. If you have been here longer than 5 minutes, you will know we have other jokes too. You know, cause jokes are funny and shit, not fucking advice to be taken literally....

&#x200B;

**Any questions for ASIC?**

&#x200B;

*Why are options on the ASX not quoted by market makers*?

\- Since you can do this with professional trading systems and services easily, it looks like it creates a misbalance in the market between retail and institutions. This was actually requested by multiple mods. Apparently this question was not immediately answerable, but they have noted it.

&#x200B;

From here on, if you see an account claiming to be **ASIC** and they have the Flair ""Official ASIC Account. For Real. Seriously."" then that is them.

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

At this point, we don't really have that much to tell anyone.

We had left a joke in the FAQ and forgotten about it which mentioned Rockets equaling winning, which has been deleted upon request. Otherwise, they don't seem to have any issues with the ship we run.

The Mod who attended did say that they wanted this to be the most respectable, least dodgy part of the ASX social media...Cuckold references, Body fluid consumption and general idiocy aside, I think we've done that. We also do Koala and charity stuff.

So if you're just a plain old legit, real fucking idiot that belongs here, good work. If you're some asshole who wants to use this sub as victims of your scams, will you please fuck right off....

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,mai50l,Can we get some legit discussion on RLT?,"So many moons ago i was pumping VUL with an internal price target of $2.50 based on a broker report i read and confirmed by my own research. That was fucking blown out of the water and it FOMO-Hyper-Hype-trained all the way to $14. 

After that I was telling people to get in on BPH with an internal price target of about 10c. This one was based a bit more on guess work and going through the history of BUY/BPH and what happened last time they drilled. However this was blown out of the water when it FOMO-Hyper-Hype-trained all the way to 33c. 

So apparently my internal price targets are too conservative. However I am hesitant to lift them lest I get too greedy. 

This brings us to RLT. I said i thought it was going to go above $2 back when it was around the low $1 mark. It not only went up to $2 it nearly touched $3. I fucked up an easy free carry by doubling down and then tripling down by accident at close to the all time highs. For posterity's sake i'll post my buy/sell history with RLT and you can see how fucked up emotions can make your trading.

 [Here you go](https://imgur.com/a/Q81Rvy4)

Anyway it closed fairly comfortably above $2 and I would like some other opinions on what you think a fair price would be. Personally? I am aiming for $5 a share. 

I have seen some of the hawtcopper pumpers give an upper price estimate of $80 a share if the helium grades are 12% but I think that is wildly optimistic. 

This current run up could be FOMO on drilling results which are due soon [1 day and 12 hours](https://www.renergen.co.za/renergen-projects/milestones/) or any number of other things.

Don't let this distract you from [my recent DD on EOL](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m91fdr/energy_one_eol_undiscovered_profitable_saas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Go and read it if you haven't already. If your attention span has not been soaked up, have a load of this.

**Background**

On Friday, u/spammington posted to the sub a screenshot from Twitter, showing our revered ex-Deputy Prime Minister, awarded Johnny Depp doghunter and allround snatch-hound Barnaby Joyce... disclosing something.  Barny had placed a trade for his child (one of six), Sebastian Joyce.

For those who don't know, at just six weeks old, Sebastian obtained a trust fund (according to the daily mail) of about $150k, which has been filled up with TV royalties coming out of an exclusive scoop on the affair which produced young Sebastian. Now he's two years old and Barny has just purchased a parcel of **ASX:EOS**, Electro Optic Systems for Sebastian's trust fund. It has raised some eyebrows since EOS works in the military sector and heavily relies on Federal funding. Nobody has used the word corrupt. Not me. No sir. Nope.

But it got a few people theorising, if all Federal politicians need to disclose their holdings - what do they hold? u/The_lordofruin drops the link for all politicians' disclosures. Someone talked about using a scraper or computers. Well I'm impatient and a moron, so I spent two hours downloading and reading each PDF on the disclosure website and put it all into a spreadsheet. You might know Monty Python or whatever but I'm a lawyer and reading PDFs and extracting mundane data is what I do.

I have not included holdings in private companies or SMSFs which almost certainly hold shares for the relevant pollies, because the disclosure doesn't go that deep. What I have included are all shares held by the pollie, their spouse or their kids in public companies. Also, bar two or three, each of these guys own at least one property and the vast majority own multiple properties. Some own up to 10. Ski lodges, holiday homes, investment properties - its crazy... Property, not equity, is the drug of choice for these guys.

&#x200B;

**What is below**

* Funny shit I found
* Table/ranking of instances of each stock
* Table of who owns which stock

&#x200B;

**Before the list**

Can we just talk about the fact that there are politicians with the following names:

* Milton Dick
* David Littleproud
* Ian Goodenough
* Patrick Possum Gorman

I feel like this gives valuable insight into why they're all such venemous individuals. Imagine growing up with a name like that.

Also, reading Bob Katter's disclosure reads exactly how he sounds. He refused to disclose his wife's shareholdings as she *literally told him to bugger off* and Katter ostensibly, whipped by his ball and chain, upped his bar of transperancy for his Mrs, unlike every single other politician. He failed to elicit the information from his Mrs and hasn't disclosed anything on her behalf. God bless Queenslanders. He also raved about some gold mining rights, that he 'is thinking of actioning in the future'. We have a prospector in Parliament!

Many, including the PM, put investments in a company usually controlled by their spouse (Richard Marles, Scomo's SMSF, Daniel Tehan's company 'Tehan trade') which ostensibly hold shares but sadly we can't see what shares they hold. Also Tony Pasin has a family trust called the ""Pepe Family Trust"".

Amanda Rishworth filled out her form, thinking Westpac is ""westpack"" and calling Perpetual ""per perpetual fund"" and Challenger the ""challengar fund"". Should politicians do an IQ test: Y/N.

Also, put out your tendies for Vince Connelly, his only investment is BZM, and it is in liquidation. RIP for our brother.

&#x200B;

**Honorable mentions**

There ARE sub favourites in the list. Can confirm that Federal politicians own the following stocks:

* 4DS
* Z1P
* APT
* PNV
* APX
* IXR
* LYC

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m93ked,Are Red Fridays a meme or is there real money to be made? This is how you could've beat the market and made an 84% return trading only BBOZ on Thursdays and Fridays.,"G'day cunts, I've missed shitposting with y'all this past week but I'm proud/scared to see DLC taking a deeper place inside this sub. If ASIO asks, I hadn't nothing to do with it. 

In the meantime, I've been distracting myself from real life tasks by joining the algo revolution and learning how to use python for finance. Being a masterful procrastinator, I took on the challenge of using nerd power to figure out how much of a meme Red Fridays are.

#**What do I mean by Red Friday?**

Since I've been on this sub, the general sentiment is that the market shits the bed more often than not at the end of the week. Pre-market threads are filled with nervous posts, and orders for lube in preparation for the onslaught of red triangles. 
But what if there was a way to turn the tide on the Friday red market dildo, and shove a green one back up Tomsexx?

#**What are BBOZ/BBUS?**

Once upon a time, BBOZ and BBUS were the hottest tickers on this sub. Veterans of this sub already know them intimately, having being fucked hard post pandemic crash last year. 

[BBOZ](https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/australian-equities-strong-bear-fund/) and [BBUS](https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/us-equities-strong-bear-fund/) are leveraged BEAR ETFS (🌈🐻). Their value is negatively correlated to the S&P/ASX 200 (BBOZ) and S&P 500 (BBUS). For every 1% decrease in the ASX/US markets, BBOZ/BBUS should increase 2-2.75%, and they go down the same amount for a market increase.  If the market is going up, putting your money into BBOZ/BBUS is an excellent way to lose it. By design, they go down over time, but they let people hedge their more risky positions, which none of you fuckers care about anyway. 


#**The Hypothesis**

So with this 🌈🐻 primer, we are ready to experiment. 

If the market does indeed crash regularly on Friday, and we are not being [Fooled by Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness), we can use BBOZ/BBUS to make money. 

All we have to do is buy BBOZ/BBUS at open on Thursday, and sell at close on Friday. A simple strategy, which I tested with historical data scraped from Yahoo Finance.

#**Nerd Method Shit**

Using the [Yfinance library](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), I yoinked the opening and closing prices of BBOZ/BBUS over the 1yr and 3yr time periods. I then ran a script that would buy at open on a given weekday, and sell at close the next day (e.g Buy Monday Open, Sell Tuesday Close). This gives me data sets to compare for this swing strategy to see if what day you choose really makes a difference. Each transaction includes the $9.50 Brokerage fee that you would pay from using SelfWealth. Because this script trades frequently, brokerage fees are a fucking bitch and you have to stay the fuck away from that slut Tommsex with his cucked progressive fees. The higher your starting portfolio balance, the lower the relative percentage cost is for brokerage therefore you make more money. If you tried this starting with only $1k, you would need to make on average (9.50/1000) = 1.9% return with each trade to profit.

Starting with a balance of $10k, well below what many of you degenerates are fine with risking daily, I plotted the results for each Swing day pair, and compared it to the return of the ASX/200 (IOZ) over the same time period as a benchmark.

#**Result 1, Don't do this with BBUS**  

[Here are the results from Swing trading BBUS.](https://imgur.com/a/BdNEs09)  **They are fucking garbage**. You'd make more money in DLC over the same time. The Thursday to Friday swing does perform the best out of all combinations, and give a positive return,  but if you sat $10k in IOZ you'd be $2k richer.

There is a fun peak visible in the 3yr chart during the 🌈🐻 Pandemic Party for Wed-Thurs Swinging, but over time we see the Account Balance dwindle. This is what we should expect from the natural decay of the BBUS instrument if there are no days where the market regularly drops.


#**Result 2, BBOZ = $$$$$$$$, RED FRIDAYS ARE NOT A MEME 🤡🤡🤡**

[Here are the fucking cooked returns for BBOZ.](https://imgur.com/a/P6n8CXe) I don't know what to say. Finance is a lie. If you bought BBOZ at Thursday Open, and sold on Friday Close, every week for the past 52 weeks, **you would have an 84% Return**. Starting with $10k, you would finish with **$8.4k profit**, and **beat the index cucks by ~$5k**.

Looking across the 3yr period, we see this strategy fails before the pandemic, but something fucking crazy has happened. The market gods have henceforth declared Friday to be Red as a sacrifice, perhaps in exchange for the insane recovery. 

Breaking down the data further, [here are normalized histograms of the return % for each trade](https://imgur.com/a/RBwaUrm) across the respective time period for the Thurs-Friday swing.  From a simple gaussian fit, the average return for a Thurs-Friday Swing is +1.281% over the past year, with a standard deviation of 3.295%. 

#**Conclusions**

Red Friday has been real for the past pandemic year in Australia, but does not work using BBUS. We haven't been imagining things, this is a real phenomenon. If you had acted on this exploit, with this strategy **your portfolio would be up +84%**, starting from $10k and using SelfWealth.

#**Why am I posting this here for everyone to see?**

**1. I want validation and I want to show off my new python skills.**

**2. I don't have enough money to exploit this properly, its all tied up in Uranium**

I will not be trading BBOZ weekly, in spite of this stupidly high return that exploits a literal ASX_Bets meme.

**3. Past Performance =/= future results.**

Just because it has happened historically, does not mean it will continue. Its a weird, spontaneous pattern that hasn't gone away and has fucked us repeatedly this past year. Maybe this post will change that. 

**4. Its fucking hilarious and I can't not share this now**

#Appendix: Return of Green Monday

So just as an afterthought, I tested the corollary, what happens if you buy the Long leveraged ASX ETF (GEAR) for the same swing?

[Here are the results.](https://imgur.com/a/cZO40Ro) Monday to Tuesday swing returns the greatest, at 94%. GEAR has performed very nicely this year, as you can see with the black line, but the Mon-Tues Swing is still beating it. What would happen if you combined the BBOZ/GEAR swing? 🤔

#Appendix 2: I am an unstoppable Leverage Monster (combined BBOZ/GEAR Play, 270% return)

Alrighty so after that cliffhanger of an appendix, this is the result. Took around 1hr of abusing my spaghetti code to produce this [INFINITE MONEY GLITCH](https://imgur.com/a/sC2xtGe) (leverage is one hell of a drug).

**Overview**

EOL is a *consistently profitable* Aussie SaaS company with a market cap of 167m and YoY increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margins, as well as a decreasing churn rate. It has just gone international and has seen massive earnings growth with a huge market share still to be captured. There are more price catalysts coming. The stock is not hyped on reddit (zero mentions before this post) and twitter/HC chat is minimal. The company's offering includes the trading of energy derivatives and the scheduling of physical energy (including electricity, gas, liquid commodities and environmental and carbon trading). EOL has offices in Australia, UK and France, with 200+ customer installations in 19 countries, including many with blue-chip international utility and infrastructure companies.

This company has exciting upcoming price catalysts and international ambitions. For context, EOL has market share approaching 50% in Australia (basically a duopoly here, which is a great position to be in), 15% in the UK and less than 5% in Europe. In late 2019 they acquired an EU entity (eZ-nergy) HQ'd in Paris and before that in late 2018 acquired a UK based ETRM company. They are considering a US entry in the next 3 or so years if the circumstances are right, and they're eying another European acquisition soon. Have the acquisitions done well? Well... read on and find out. But European revenue is now more than 50% of the company's global revenue, after just 2 years. Interested? You should be.

&#x200B;

**Chart**

As of posting, EOL last closed at $6.61. I'm no TA expert, but I've included the chart because its good a good shape and the MA is doing what solid long term stocks should do:

[EOL may try to find new levels of support at around 6.10 so be mindful of a potential pullback from today's levels if considering an entry. ](https://preview.redd.it/bapafou2o4o61.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=2068524855788ca6af5be447ea63310359d64d53)

&#x200B;

**The product**

Its not the most sexy of SaaS companies, probably why its not 'in play' since it doesnt offer BNPL or EV edge. Instead, EOL provides Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) software which is 'mission critical' to its clients, who supply countries with energy (an essential service). What on earth is ETRM you're probably asking - don't worry, I had no idea either. Theres a section below which details what this is in a bit more detail but essentially it means contract management for recording physical trades for power on energy markets, assisting power stations selling their power on energy markets, providing buyers of power with valuations and data, assisting strategic players with carbon trading management and helping clients ensure an efficient allocation of energy, infrastructure and logistics through optimisation. Why is this important?

1. Energy is a critical asset;
2. The software is heavily integrated with its customers, and has a very low churn rate;
3. Renewables are set to shake up the energy market by making fluctuations in demand and supply (and therefore fluctuations in price). EOL's product helps clients navigate those changes and stay ontop of bidding, energy valuations and hedging.
4. Carbon trading is massive in Europe, where EOL has just expanded to in the last year or two. Australia *nearly* got an emissions trading scheme under both Rudd and Turnbull. There is consensus among centre right and left that an ETS is the way to go to deal with reduction of carbon. (Basically you need to buy carbon credits if you emit, and you can sell carbon credits if you reduce carbon in the atmosphere, by 'putting a price on carbon'). EOL's product helps all suppliers and consumers of energy trade carbon credits.
5. Moat wise, Commodity Trading and Risk Management (CTRM) systems dominate the strategic landscape because CTRM’s do everything from Cocoa beans to Copper. Electricity however is a unique commodity that is difficult to store and needs to be transported and consumed immediately. ETRMs are better for this, and EOL specialises in ETRMs. When you get to competitors below you'll see that this is not a crowded market.

Honestly you can probably skip down to the financials if you don't care about the product in any more depth, but if you do want to know a bit more about the software - the company's product has three main offerings.

* Bidding services - which allow a power station to bid it’s electricity (quantity, price, time and place) into a National Electricity Market. Takes into account potential constraints in the transmission system allowing optimum dispatch for companies with multiple generators. ***ELI5***\*:\* bidding in spot market, valuations of power purchase agreements, carbon trading management - help clients with the prices of energy when buying or selling it.
* ETRM services: contract management for recording physical trades (PPA’s) and financial derivatives (Swaps, Options, Caps etc). Records the trade allocating it to a hedge book / portfolio. As market prices change hedge books are revalued. Forward books can be five years of more. Provides risk analytics such as GMaR, VaR, CaR, Monte Carlo etc. Electricity, gas, carbon, diesel, coal and Fx are all covered. ***ELI5***: contract management, reducing supply during adverse price movements against the client, hedging using derivates to protect the client against those moves, and tools to monitor energy market and execute derivatives.
* Business automation services: Many systems and contracts in energy markets can be complex. EOL's tools automate complex but mundane tasks increasing accuracy and efficiency. ***ELI5***: EOL's software can be used to help transport gas from one point through several different pipelines for a more efficient logistics exercise, for example. Efficient allocation of energy, infrastructure and logistics saves the client money and time.

&#x200B;

The company has virtually no debt (1.1% D/E ratio)

Not that we really care as young primates, but the company's dividend yield has reduced from 1.5% to 0.5% since the company's second EU acquisition in late 2019 through COVID and up to today. This isn't a bad thing really, they're reinvesting earnings in the business and growing their international market share - this is good for long term SP growth as opposed to income from dividends, so it suits a long-term growth investor which is probably how most of us would categorise ourselves.

&#x200B;

**Management / Internal ownership**

CEO has 3.24% (5.4m) of the company

CFO has 1.24% (2.1m) of the company

CEO of European ops has 0.78% ($302k)

Ian Ferrier has 26.77% (this guy is on the board of Goodman Group, Reckon Ltd and Briscoe Wong Ferrier and has been on the board of EOL for 14 years - nearly as long as Goodman Group, a profitable REIT focussed on distribution centres globally). He previously founded Ferrier Hodgson, a corporate recovery firm that was bought by KPMG recently. I work in the corporate recovery space and Ferriers was highly respected and a good business.

Vaughan Busby has 15.88%. This guy worked for Ian as a director at Ferrier Hodgson and has since held a number of board spots on Energy companies around Australia. Hes currently on the board of EOL and the board of Energy Queensland. Hes also a principal at Rearden Capital - a Sydney based fund manager specialising in originating and managing senior secured infrastructure debt on behalf of wholesale investors.

Ian and Vaughan are from the corporate recovery world and are highly qualified accountants who have strong skills in turning around unhealthy companies - they made their money doing this for decades. The fact that they are so heavily invested in this company speaks volumes about its financial health and prospects. An insolvency practitioner would not invest in a company with a risk of losing their investment.

We saw big insider buying in May - June last year, during COVID. Good to see confidence in the business even when major markets took a hit. Be mindful also the company grew EBITDA even through COVID so not a hard decision to buy more as the shares dipped (to as low as $2.20). Just wish I knew about this stock then. We've seen some offloading from Ian and Vaughan in the last 3-6mths but they still hold very significant portions of this company (the % above).

&#x200B;

**The clients**

Clients of EOL are mainly utilities companies – such as power stations and vertically integrated retailers. Infrastructure providers – such as gas pipelines, electricity transmission. Here's flowchart of how these clients fit together.

[Basically all of the navy blue tiles on the left plus the grey tile. Orange and aqua tiles are the services they provide.](https://preview.redd.it/nr5sm5w0k4o61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c32744cc24dafc9544ca490902cbb35c4b87c93)

&#x200B;

**Stickiness and churn**

Churn is a key metrics for SaaS companies. Churn is the rate of lost clients after having them sign up. Stickiness just means how integral the software is to a company's operations. Slack is not a sticky product since it can be replaced with any instant messaging app. Microsoft office or Xero on the other hand are very sticky because their integrations with the business run deep. A stickier SaaS product is better because clients lament thinking about swapping it out and are more likely to cop higher prices for the service and hang around for longer.

EOL's churn is 2.5%, down half from last year. Average life-time value (LTV) (ELI5: net profit per customer) has been growing each year. Large blue-chip customers consider ETRM software mission critical so installing new enterprise style ETRM software involves large, sophisticated projects.

Contract lengths: 1-5 year initial term, then annual renewals - nice and long contracts so in addition to the software being sticky, the contract terms are locked in for long durations.

Cross selling wide, Energy One looks to sell more than one product from their range to customers. Currently average 1.2 products per customer with 4 products the highest.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

None are listed on exchanges anywhere - only private equity. ETRM vendors tend to be specialist suppliers, the majority of which are owned by private equity so this company is a unique trading opportunity for retail investors.

https://preview.redd.it/6mnak0gjk4o61.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09913e4434e5a1087c19ad6907dbb6ba733406a

**Upcoming price catalysts**

* recently moved into Europe, only have 5% of market share there but have already receieved massive revenue boosts.
* European revenue growth was up 83% over pcp. Want to leverage eZ-nergy product. European revenue is now more than 50% of the company's global revenue after just 2 years.
* NPAT for the first half of FY2021 is already more than all of FY20 demonstrating a large upswing in fundamentals.
* EBITDA margin increased by 30% pcp - this is why we love SaaS companies
* Company guidance for EBITDA for FY21 is up to $8m from $5m actual last year
* Company presentations state that ""Scope exists for another complementary European acquisition""
* US expansion ""being considered in the next 2-3 years should the right opportunity arise""

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

EOL is a solid profitable SaaS business with a low <150m market cap that specialises in ETRMs - the most efficient way to trade energy. Energy markets are only going to get more complex with volatile prices as supply becomes more intermittent as renewables are phased in, along with carbon credits.  The busines has a very low churn which is shrinking YoY and high stickiness, strong client base (startups all the way through to blue chips), a pattern of successful acquisitions and an untapped market share in Europe and the United States. I'm bullish on this company from a FA perspective.

Congratulations on getting to the end. Here is your reward you dope fiend:

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m8c0wf,AVENG + McConnell Dowell - Just some DD for your thoughts,"https://preview.redd.it/w7bhw613xxn61.jpg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=175f57f578c7d21064bf46f2797cdbc4b23a2467

Hello ASX and welcome to my TendieTalk from ZA,

&#x200B;

I thought I'd make my first post about a company that has been around for some time to get your thoughts and input?

**Initial thought:**

Have you ever heard of the ""Lindy Effect""? No? Well... (From Wikipedia) "" The **Lindy effect** is a theorized phenomenon by which the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy""

&#x200B;

**Now let's have a look at the business...**

This business has been around since 1880... It has survived the best and the worst of times including 2 pandemics if you count this one.

This is a construction mining company that owns much of its value chain across most of South Africa, Africa, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  Yep - they even hang around your back yard.

&#x200B;

They have more than 100 entities under their subsidiary list  They surged in the 2010s and burned out when the SA construction business died and dragged them and their competitors down with them with debt.

Unlike their competitors, they survived. They put into action a turnaround strategy to offload non-core assets and entities and they have survived a valley of death that began in 2017. They've turned a profit for the first time in \~7 years. Their NAV is 10c (\~1 Australian cent), but it is likely their NAV is higher since they've raised funds through a rights offer that has been aggressively taken up - The rights offer in now concluded with it having been taken up almost immediately by the shareholders from big corporates to the little guy like me.

JP Morgan and its subsidiary just moved in and bought a \~25%+ stake in the company and a few other hedge funds have hopped in.  They only have a 25% exposure to South Africa, the rest of the exposure is in SE Asia and Australia, and they are primed to benefit from government capital injections stimulus post Covid-19 recovery. They have an order book amounting to R27.7-billion which is \~2.3 billion Australian dollars, with \~52% of that book in Australia (Can you tell we like you guys?).  This share has the potential to be a 20x bagger... It is basically an IPO at this stage but with 141 year history. Their debt is beginning to be sustainable and they have no where to go but up - I'd add the rockets in here... but I mean... Hakuna ma-tendies.

&#x200B;

Anyway - Thank you for reading my post. From the boys and girls of r/JSE_Bets and our Discord Server - to you, Our friends.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Share code:  JSE:AEG

You can trade it on [IG.com](https://IG.com)  
I have also emailed EasyEquities to find out if you can purchase ZA shares via their Australian partners (My apologies - I did not thing about this (that you would want to buy) when I first posted this). 

**Edit:**   
Please let me clarify. The purpose of this post is not to pump this share - not at all - else I wouldn't have needed the above edit. 

It is to get inputs and thoughts from a bigger group of people (JSE\_Bets has a small member count of only 2.2k members) Their inputs are greatly valued and affect much of the stocks I now buy. 

I wanted to get input from ASX on this business because they have ties in Australia. I'm a newbie to stocks trading - I only started a few weeks back and I find it valuable to get the inputs of people from all places now when buying stock - I thought it would be silly of me not to ask inputs from this community on this business.

There are 62,000+ of us dumb cunts on here, meaning it would cost less than $100 each to buy all of the company's outstanding shares on the ASX.

Our mods would make an excellent board, free uranium dildos for our wives' boyfriends to use on her, basically no downside really 🤔

*Edit 1: here is a more accurate estimate...*

Let's value all of company's shares at $0.015 (latest sell price is $0.007) as the ""premium"" for this premier, amazing company:

$15,129,318 total for shares, from what I can see they have roughly $8 million in assets, so say \~$23 million total, let's call it $25m due to paying a premium for their ownership to want to give away rights to their famously high-grade dildos.

**$25,000,000 ➗ 62,300 = \~$400 per member here to buy ownership of DLC, including existing dildos + dildo warehousing + 1 x heavily used excavator they use for mining**

**Long Term Price Target: $4 and above.**

&#x200B;

After the capital raise today the SP started taking off as more and more people realised who the new investors were and the valuable highly limited resource that KIS has.

See below comment from ""Phuket Guy"" on hotcopper regarding some of the names involved in this management / capital raise.

**""THE BILLIONAIRES CLUB** \-Well big news today. I said this was EXTREMELY BULLISH! and great research finding out that this DACH group was behind it. We heard that the cornerstone investors behind this placement were huge. But this mob are about as big, strong rich,and highly respected as any European or global investment group. All of them are billionaires. Plus they own about 7 huge banks between them!

I have also heard that since the Tasi govt gave their AUD 10 mill grant - KIS has already got bank offers for the balance of the full debt financing from locals Oz banks. Any of these guys private banks could fund it too - so with a group of this caliber behind them - the debt financing is a given - no two ways about it.

I would also say that after that Tasi minister went down in the mine and mass tweeted a vid saying the govt was going to"" help the mine develop"" its probably also a given that the next federal grant (yes, grant not loan! - which means free money) for AUD 15 or 20 million from the new 1.2 billion fed govts new critical metals development fund - is now also a given. (PS someone should look behind where that money came from-id bet theres US govt money behind it) So anyway to me getting financing is no longer an issue.

Meanwhile the shareholding in this little out-in-left field asx junior is increasingly looking like wall-to-wall billionaires - so doesn't that tell you normal investors something?. Go with the smart money?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lets recap.**

&#x200B;

firstly there's the two founders multi-hundred millionaires **Chris Ellis** and his partner who pulled off a coup of selling their previous coal project for (was it 1.1billion USD -If my mind serves me rightly) They own 44% of the company

Next in was local Tasi billionaire **Dan Elphinstone** Tasmania's richest man. (who came in at same time as us, the ***10baggerclub*** \-(and we have 2 billionaire members and several big multi millionaires.)

Now we have the German Redbull Billionaire, **Dietrich Mateschitz** (one of Germanys richest men)

and critical metals specialist and investor an almost billionaire **Heimo Quaderer.**

Then theres Billionaire ***Prince*** **Michael of Lichtenstein** a renowned smart investor and also the head and part owner of LGT group, the biggest family-owned private banking and asset management group in the world.

And lastly there the co director and large investor billionaiire Austrian banker HRH **Simeon von Habsburg**\- from **one of, if not the, richest family in Europe**, he is also MD of their private bank VP bank in Lichtenstein where some of Europes wealthiest families and industrialists bank.

Mates! do i need to say more! why TF do you think they re all piling into and buying this junior ASX stock? why were three big US institutions knocked back for this placement? Why do you think the Tasi govt and next the federal Govt are going to give loans and grants to this company do you think its a coincidence???

They have all figured out what ive been telling you all for since last October! The west is out of High quality tungsten. This in the only known mine left. The western governments need it at any cost to run their high-tech medical industry and more importantly their militaries!

This mine will now get its financing for sure, It will go into production, almost all its off-take is already agreed on a take-or-pay basis.

And moreover IMO the high purity Tungsten price is going through the roof in the near future as people fight for it, There are no other high purity tungsten mines known in the west and even if one is discovered it takes years to get them into commissioning.

This share is going a lot higher, so close your eyes and buy! Don't try to out think the billionaires,- you've all heard of follow the smart money right? They were buying today - so buy this stock - up to even 40-50 cents.

If you don't you will probably only sit there watching it go up and regret not buying it! and IMO do it ASAP before the European market figures out why this power group of investors (probably no 1 group in the German speaking world) have gone into this obscure little stock on little King Island in the bass straits!

I own millions of share but i went and bought more at 27 cents today!

I rest my case M'lord.!""

Pull up a camping chair, grab a snag, crack open a bevvie of preference and let’s have a bant 

**Name**: AAU - Antilles  

**MC**: 18.5 m 

**AV Volume 304 k**

**SP**: 0.11

**Background:**

First thing, it’s a fuckin shame that this company missed a star wars reference in the name. If you know you know.

All ya need to know is that this fuckin thing hasn’t been mentioned **ONCE** on this sub. What the ever loving fuck are you fart sniffing bum-catchers doing here?

All right, now that the money grubbers have fucked off, lets get down to business. This cunt is a fuckin beaty and Is primarily located in the Greater Antilles Islands Cuba and the Dominican Republic. 

According to its website - Owns ‘*a patented Albion Oxidation Process is a processing technology that permits the extraction of precious metals from refractory ore by conventional techniques.*

*Most sulphide ores can not be leached at acceptable rates at atmospheric pressure.*

*Feed to the Albion Process is in the form of a sulphide concentrate containing precious metals.*  

*The Albion Process utilises both ultrafine grinding and oxidative leaching at atmospheric pressure to oxidise the concentrate and allow metal extraction utilising cyanide-in-leach technology.*

*A major benefit of the Albion Process, in addition to relatively low capital and operating costs, is that it renders arsenic, which tends to be prevalent in refractory ores, as a stable, non-soluble ferric arsenate which permits environmentally safe deposition in tailings storage facilities.’* 

**Key Highlights:** 

* Chairman Brain Johnson, *hehehe,* has been hoarding shares like a kleptomanic magpie that has a penchant for crack-coated silver. He owns 36% of the company.    
* PE ratio (3.9x) is below the Australian market (19.7x)
* Profitable (wot? We don’t do that here)
* 58% of the company is owned by insiders 

**Future Outlook:** 

Look, I have a crystal ~~meth~~ ball and I gotta good feeling about this company. 

According the the West Australian - 

*Antilles Gold has launched a massive 25,000 metre drilling campaign across its La Demajagua gold and silver project in Cuba. The company is looking to delineate a resource over the deposit with the current drilling program also set to provide bulk samples for metallurgical test work as Antilles eyes a rapid move into a feasibility study for its precious metal-rich project in the Caribbean.*

*Antilles’ enticing precious metals project is located 27km south-west of the regional centre of Nueva Gerona, with the centrepiece of the acquisition being the dormant Delita gold and silver mine. Delita has a history of production dating back to the 1920s however it has been mined only on a modest scale, with artisanal operations and smaller mining groups having extracted high-grade gold ores via underground operations between 1947 and 1989.*

*Based upon previous metallurgical work undertaken by internationally recognised SGS-Lakefield in Canada, the sulphide concentrate would grade at an eye-catching 47 g/t gold and 380 g/t silver, delivering around 90,500 ounces of gold and 730,000 ounces of silver into Antilles’ coffers per annum.*

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m571uw,I created a spreadsheet that tracks insider transactions for all ASX-listed companies - Enjoy,"Updated version [https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX\_Bets/comments/m65jjh/insider\_transactions\_spreadsheet\_updated\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m65jjh/insider_transactions_spreadsheet_updated_to/)

# TL;DR

Hi everyone,

I'm releasing a spreadsheet I created with the details of insider buying and selling for any ASX-listed company within the last 6 months. The spreadsheet automatically updates every day.

**Link to the insider transactions sheet.**

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UselLLx5\_-gyUmciP3Pw-2kMcVyAeGfFiGyWK3-TQBk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UselLLx5_-gyUmciP3Pw-2kMcVyAeGfFiGyWK3-TQBk)

**Example stock screener using this data.**

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T6VCpn1Z61NgoxvGlmMz3YmHGfSCI-lAtjXasIHoidU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T6VCpn1Z61NgoxvGlmMz3YmHGfSCI-lAtjXasIHoidU/edit?usp=sharing)

# The motivation behind it.

I think spreadsheets are incredibly valuable for conducting analysis and due diligence of a company. There are so many methodologies when it comes to investing that having a dashboard that will fit all styles is not do-able. This to me is the power of spreadsheets. I can easily customize it to suit the needs of my investing style, to show me the metrics I want, and even write formulas to create new ones. I can transform the data however I see fit.

Because of these benefits, my spreadsheet is always my first view of a company. It's where I get the big picture of a companies fundamentals. From there, I can quickly tell whether I want to dig deeper.

However, up until recently, I had to use a tool like MarketIndex to review insider transactions. This isn't such a problem when I review single stocks, but what about when I want to screen hundreds? Manually checking each and everyone would be extremely arduous and time-consuming. Recent insider buying or selling can serve as a great indicator of management's confidence in upcoming events.

# How to use it.

If you're familiar with Google Sheets, this should be reasonably simple. You can copy and paste the below formula into an empty workbook.

`=IMPORTRANGE(""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UselLLx5_-gyUmciP3Pw-2kMcVyAeGfFiGyWK3-TQBk"", ""A1:E2000"")`

This formula imports the cell range `A1:E2000` from my sheet to yours. I recommend this method over simply duplicating my spreadsheet because the data is updated every day and you won't get that benefit if you create a hard copy.

Your workbook should look similar to the picture below.

[Shows your workbook now filled with the data from the imported sheet.](https://preview.redd.it/vt347wzfo2n61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a1ca1163049a6427ab44525fc131e6cfa40e05)

From a different workbook, you can now use the VLOOKUP function to search for the tickers you want to get insider transaction data for.

`=VLOOKUP(""LRS"", insiders_raw!$A$1:$E$2000, 2, FALSE)`

In the example formula above, our insider data is stored in a workbook called `insiders_raw`. We're using a VLOOKUP formula from a different workbook to search our raw insider data for the ticker `LRS`.

The `2` in the formula tells it to get the result of column 2 which in this case would be the number of insider buys for LRS. If you want to get the total $ cost (how much money was spent) of those transactions, you would change that 2 to a 3 like so.

`=VLOOKUP(""LRS"", insiders_raw!$A$1:$E$2000, 3, FALSE)`

Sell orders would be 4.

`=VLOOKUP(""LRS"", insiders_raw!$A$1:$E$2000, 4, FALSE)`

With the transacted $ value of those sell orders being 5

`=VLOOKUP(""LRS"", insiders_raw!$A$1:$E$2000, 5, FALSE)`

Buy transactions include purchasing of shares and exercise of options, it doesn't include issued shares or expiring options.

# The end.

Hopefully, this has everything needed so you can get up and running with this data but if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements please feel free to let me know.

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m4qntw,Invictus Energy (IVZ) to the moon Monday,"I've mentioned this stock quite a few times on Reddit threads before on other subs but think it deserves it's own post now... 

So to start this off, I've been holding this stock for about 1.5 years and have been buying more along the way for it to now be one of my largest holdings. To keep it short... it's an oil and gas exploration company with a block in Zimbabwe (the first oil and gas project in the country). The block was owned many years ago (early 1990s) by Exxon and so it already has about $30M worth of seismic and studies completed on it to identify what is estimated to be one of the largest undrilled structures onshore anywhere in the world (this is significant as it's a lot cheaper to drill onshore than offshore). All of this technical work was passed on to IVZ now. Exxon left the country many years ago due to the political instability, which is thankfully no longer an issue. 

The last 6-12 months on this stock has been a waiting game, waiting for the Production Sharing Agreement to be finalised and signed by the government. We have had some hints lately that it is getting close and now Zimbabwe media are reporting that it is only a week or two away ([https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2021/03/12/govt-invictus-settle-profit-sharing-deal/amp/?\_\_twitter\_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR2NMOCw21p1Xhs2xNp5Wwn3w5pKJsK9ZZZB4GwPLkBBpuQSm-vkicZC3fk](https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2021/03/12/govt-invictus-settle-profit-sharing-deal/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR2NMOCw21p1Xhs2xNp5Wwn3w5pKJsK9ZZZB4GwPLkBBpuQSm-vkicZC3fk)). I would be surprised if there is not a speeding ticket coming Monday if no announcement by the company addressing this article. It will run hard. 

The stock has also caught the attention last week of The Next Oil Rush ([nextoilrush.com/2150-will-ivz-repeat-run/](https://nextoilrush.com/2150-will-ivz-repeat-run/)) and they are tipping another 2000% run leading up to drilling, which is likely to occur late 2021. 

IVZ today is only sitting at a $50M market cap with the following big newsflow items coming up:

\- PSA signature by government (this sets the legal and fiscal framework for the project and basically gives it the all clear to go ahead). Massive de-risking news, likely to be announced in the next week or two. I'd expect this should send the stock to 15-20c... 

\- Farm-out 50% of the project to a large oil company in exchange for free carried drilling of 2 wells, some seismic and back-payment of previous costs. They already have a non-binding farm-out agreement in place and I bet it is just conditional on the Production Sharing Agreement being finalised... so once the PSA is signed, I'd expect farm-out to occur shortly after. Again, this is a huge de-risking event and will send the share price flying or at least support the run after the PSA signature news. 

\- Seismic activity is expected to start in April. This will help them improve on the previously shot seismic to better decide where to drill the wells. The drilling targets are already identified using the old seismic that Exxon performed but new age seismic will give even more clarity. 

\- Drilling of 2 wells late 2021. This is the jackpot, exploration stocks run hard in to drilling. Especially when it is an elephant scale target like this one that is onshore and would be super cheap to develop. IVZ already have agreements in place to sell some of the gas once it is developed - it is a starved gas market in this part of Africa and they will need the energy going forward. 

\- If the well is successful and hits oil/gas, we go to the moon. It will be one of the largest onshore discoveries in the continent in a country with a starving gas market. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. 

\- The Zimbabwe government have named this as a priority project. It will be the first oil and gas project in the country so they will not want to mess it up and put companies off investing in the country in future. They have also offered great tax terms (5 year tax holiday, 15% tax rates, etc.) to make it a very attractive development. It pays to be first at the table in Africa because companies that follow will be taking less risk so will not get as attractive terms. 

The best stock for comparison is another exploration company called ReconAfrica, see the below chart for their newsflow and shareprice response:

Comparison table between IVZ and Recon shows IVZ is the less risky play:

Also, if the main concept is pumpamentals (from the majority of posts I've seen), is the premise that listed public stocks are more 'risk off' compared to crypto and hence these are surer bets/have less possible downside, exit scams etc?Otherwise, I don't quite get why you'd gamble on the ASX with short term hopium trades when crypto markets have much higher upsides, are way easier to read sentiment and have lower fees for trading.

Dont get me wrong, there's some sharp folks here doing their due diligence and sharing their analysis and congrats to those who are making strategies and executions work for them... just yeah, surprised this took off during a huge crypto bullrun that's the world craziest casino. Or are most people also over at Binance doing their thing and have taken those risk profiles over to the ASX to try and capitalise on other sectors beyond nascent tech that crypto offers access to?

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m3xnxm,WHY IXR WILL BRING ME LOTS OF TENDIES! MY YOLO/DD,"TL;DR: rare earths go brrrr; IXR has a massive easy to mine deposit which will make the stock price go brrrr too.

Update: independent research report calling this the holy grail of REE deposits. See [here.](https://www.hallgartenco.com/pdf/RareEarths/IonicRE_March2021.pdf) 


So here goes my first YOLO and DD all in one.

Who ever it was that posted a request to be told about a YOLO before it rockets, here it is.

We all know the value being placed in speccy miners right now, but i think IXR (Ionic Rare Earths) is one that has been really overlooked.

**So much so that I've gone for a $50K YOLO on them.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qussau89opm61.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8615e62215fb3d14c42d4ae1a8f063789d71ab6

Heavy and Critical rare earths are in all the cool new toys that we all use every day and the ones we love the idea of going forward.

They are used for everything from iphones to wind turbines to fighter jets and are critical for the creation of electric cars.

**Market opportunity:**

The vast majority of the rare earths trade comes from China, who have said two things recently:

1. They have a dwindling supply compared to what has been available over the past 40 years.
2. They are going to prioritise supply into their domestic market

When this was announced you saw companies such as Lynas jump 10% as non china suppliers will become crucial going forward.

&#x200B;

**So where does IXR fit in:**

IXR have a huge Ionic clay rare earths deposit in Uganda.

These deposits are the same type of deposits that are mined in Southern China.

IXR recently announced a major upgrade (300%) of their resource estimate for the deposit and have flagged that nearby tenements they are still drilling into have the possibility to increase the overall size of the project another 50% (So 450% above original estimates).

See here: [https://smallcaps.com.au/ionic-confirms-boost-makuutu-rare-earths-resources/](https://smallcaps.com.au/ionic-confirms-boost-makuutu-rare-earths-resources/)

&#x200B;

**Why are they undervalued:**

Unlike most other non-China rare earths companies, Ionic clay deposits are very easy to extract as they are effectively already separated from rock through natural methods.

The deposits are just below the surface.  You'll note in the docs below that most drilling was down only 17m. Compare that to oil/etc etc that often need to go down kms.

So that makes ionic clay deposits incredibly cost effective to mine with a massive margin.

Couple that with the increasing cost of Rare Earths it makes the IXR project very compelling.

Further, the MD has also flagged there is the possibility to produce Scandium from the same mine, setting up a second significant revenue stream.

Checkout this comparison from SetFireToTheHive (who i think is well known on hotcrapper) which shows the relative margins on ionic deposits vs those embedded in rock and you can see the massive difference in margin.

[https://twitter.com/setfire2thehive/status/1364479875118112769](https://twitter.com/setfire2thehive/status/1364479875118112769)

Compare the margins between VLM and IXR and you can see how undervalued IXR is, noting that VLM has a roughly 50% higher market cap at the moment.

You can also see it called out here:

[https://stockhead.com.au/resources/whos-leading-the-race-to-join-lynas-as-australias-next-supplier-of-rare-earths/](https://stockhead.com.au/resources/whos-leading-the-race-to-join-lynas-as-australias-next-supplier-of-rare-earths/)

Further, IXR has just done a $12m cap raise which landed late Feb at 4c a share (Current price is 4.8c) so they are fully funded through to end of 2022 and the bankable feasibility study and mining licence application.

**Management Team:**

They have a whole bunch of guys I've never heard of with very impressive LinkedIn pages that show experience in bringing these types of projects to production.

See: [https://ionicre.com.au/why-ionic/leadership-team/](https://ionicre.com.au/why-ionic/leadership-team/)

But what really sells it for me is that the management team has a 10% stake in the company, which means their interests align with ours.

In fact in the video linked at the bottom you can see the MD talk about their cost management and how they are doing everything they can to make the most of every dollar. So far they have succeeded spending only $4m to get to this point of an approx $150m market cap.

&#x200B;

**What are the risks:**

It's in Africa.

That was the first thing that came up here, however i think this is a perception issue more than a practical one.

The deposit is in close proximity to tier 1 infrastructure, including a major rail line and port to be able to ship the product all over the world.

Further, their holding is through a ugandan company which includes ugandan nationals which have links to government and decision makers. This could mean they are greasing their palms, but the end result would be the same.

Also, these projects provide major employment opportunities to local communities so there is strong government incentive to get them going, and it's unlikely ScoMo will pop up at a press conference and say he doesn't like the project on a whim.

It's still early.

Production is slated for start of 2023 and alot of shit can happen in two years.But that is also why now is the time to jump on. At production, it's a $1b+ company, so at a current $150m ish market cap, it's a 5-10 bagger easily within 12-24 months.

But once the scoping study is out (See below) there is no way it will stay around the 5c mark that it's at today. In fact any buy under 5 is a steal.

Rare earths prices can fluctuate.

Yep, in the past rare earth prices have fluctuated wildly, but that was before we planned to ban ICE engines and swap to electric cars, or before we were shutting down coal power plans and building wind turbines everywhere.

As the demand for these minerals sky rockets, so will the price (as it has already), and you'll see far less fluctuation in market price.

&#x200B;

**Why is now the time to jump in:**

The resource estimate saw a major jump in SP followed by a pull back most likely because of the CP sellers getting out and/or short term profit taking.

The price is now back to pre resource upgrade levels (which is crazy) suggesting some of it was priced in.

However, what is definitely not priced in is the financial scoping study which is due by the end of this month.

We know the scope is complete because the company that did it posted it on linked in, so it could drop any day now.

[https://www.linkedin.com/company/newpro-consulting-engineering-services-pty-ltd/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newpro-consulting-engineering-services-pty-ltd/)

Watch the video below and you'll see the MD talk about the scoping study giving the market the ""true sense"" of the value of the project. My view is that this will have a major re-rate once that study goes up and the market obsorbs it.

[https://cruxinvestor.com/videos/ionic-rare-earths-ixr---13m-delivers-feasibility-study-by-ye21](https://cruxinvestor.com/videos/ionic-rare-earths-ixr---13m-delivers-feasibility-study-by-ye21)

I think it's highly likely the SP will run to 6ish on the expectation of the news and into the 7s and 8s (at a minimum) once the scope is released showing just how profitable the ionic clay deposit will be.

If they release further drill results increasing the size of the deposit, that would also see the SP jump.

Lastly, if the above hasn't helped, do a search on twitter for $IXR. you'll see a number of popular twitter traders posting about the potential for IXR and the massive opportunity it has infront of it.

1.5) even in if legalisation is slow continued global medical testing will create some demand
2) being an island in woop woop and strong regulatory bodies Aussie companies might have a competitive advantage at home and in the OCE
3) due to higher regulations and premium manufacturing costs there will be a premium on Australian products but they could be marketed as premium medical grace products

2hqqj5,ASX_Bets,m2kr6b,"Of Drills, Dildos, and Downright insanity: What the scary influence of this sub on DLC means for us.","You may have noticed a suspicious amount of activity regarding a certain mining and dildo company in the pre and market discussion threads today. I confess, this morning upon seeing [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1vhgi/its_always_sunny_at_dlc_board_meetings/) post I came up with the bright idea of shitposting until a Motley Fool article gets written about the most dogshit stock on the ASX. 

The joke of DLC is that any two year old with half a brain should take two seconds to realize that it is an absolute dog of a company. Its shares are diluted to shit such that its stock price is below one cent. It has a negative revenue for the past two years. I mean, its a fucking company that sells sex toys and does mining exploration for god knows what reason.

DLC has been a running gag on this subreddit as a standard recommendation for any low-effort moron post asking what stock to buy. If you ask a retarded question on this sub, you get a retarded answer, that's what makes our culture great. There have been bets on this sub in the past where the loser has had to buy $500 worth of DLC (shout out /u/stinkyfatwhale). Regulars of this sub are fully aware of DLC's joke status .

What I did today was spam dumb information while mentioning DLC. I have never bought, and do not expect I will ever will buy a single share unless forced at gunpoint, and neither should you. 

In total, I posted **18 comments** in the pre-market thread and **17 comments** in the day-market thread mentioning the ticker DLC. Most of these were very satirical in nature, such as [""cancelling""](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1ros6/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqhw4l7/?context=3) the Motley Fool for not writing articles on DLC and claiming that DLC deserves to grow from a company losing millions to one losing tens of millions like [Z1P/APT](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1ros6/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqi12kv/?context=3)

Some of the other regulars here caught onto the gag and [joined](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1ros6/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqi7pvw/) in the [fun](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1ros6/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqi6klu/), others took two seconds to call out a blatant [""pump""](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m2bae6/market_open_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqi6si0/) while some retards were genuinely [curious](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m1ros6/premarket_thread_for_general_trading_and_plans/gqi0ry5/) in the ""hype"" of the stock. In total, DLC was **mentioned 67 times** in the pre-market thread and **mentioned 50 times** in the Market Open thread.


The result? DLC traded today at **10 TIMES** its 10 day average trading volume, and was pumped **33%** to near **6 month high of 0.008**. That is insanity. I honestly don't know what to make of this. It reminds me of this [DEFCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDamqTjPwg) presentation, where two guys (one who founded Twitch.tv) realized that the hacky spam emails they received shilling stocks actually caused rises in price that could be exploited. 

To be fair, markets do move fairly randomly, it is possible that this is a giant coincidence. DLC also had an announcement yesterday, but with no resulting price movement on that day. Gold in general was up today, for comparison ENX (a dogshit explorer I'm in ~$8m MC) was up ~4% and CHN (a $1.5b miner I'm in) was up ~6.5%, but these pale in comparison to the DLC leap. 

However, I sincerely believe the most likely explanation for this movement is that we managed to trip a sentiment algorithm scraping this subreddit today. There's a lot of fucking idiots on this sub, myself included, but I don't think any one of us will claim credit for the $315,000 worth of DLC that was traded. There was even a single purchase of $77k at at 0.007. 

If my suspicions are true, DLC has shown today that our shitposting here has consequences. This was a joke ""pump"" with **ZERO** co-ordination. It spontaneously emerged from my retarded brain this morning, and I have made no private contact with anyone else on this sub asking for ""help"". Imagine what a group of coordinated individuals taking a pump seriously could do. 

This sub has been [growing fast](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/llq0rd/subscriber_count_over_time_for_rasx_bets_we_have/) ever since GME shined the spotlight on our Mongolian basket weaving forums. Gone are the golden days where half the posts were from our memer in chief /u/bigjimbeef and the other half being an autistic mix of Melvin and Fish guts. 

Hopefully this can serve as a further wake-up call for our esteemed moderators who are already on [red-alert](https://old.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lhhvuo/killing_pump_and_dumps_targeting_rasx_bets_for/) from pumping groups attacking this sub. I think we might need further moderation rules to prevent further attacks, considering how ""easy"" this was. I think like WSB, there should be a limit on the market cap for a ticker to get mentioned here, e.g $10 million. The smaller the market cap, the greater the potential for malicious pumpers. 

I think all of us should also be more vigilant in enforcing the ""Positions or Ban"" unofficial rule. If someone is trying to hype something up, let them put their money where their mouth is or GTFO. The great shitposting culture we have here will last only as we can enforce it together.


TL:DR: This sub is an effective pumping ground, where even a joke can work. LONG DLC",https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/m2kr6b/of_drills_dildos_and_downright_insanity_what_the/,False,1615448233.0,1617017655,106,133,0.98,False
